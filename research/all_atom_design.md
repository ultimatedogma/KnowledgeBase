# All Atom Design

Why we need all atom design? In physics, the non-covalent interaction is between atoms.

- Protein-ligand interaction needs to learn more physical properties to understand
- Antibody-antigen interaction needs to learn more physical properties to understand
- Internal detailed structure needs to learn from atomic distribution
- Protein dynamics needs to learn from atomic distribution

## Summary

The Great Depression was a severe global economic crisis lasting from 1929 to 1939. Originating in the U.S. with the Wall Street Crash of October 1929, it caused drastic declines in output, severe unemployment (peaking at 25% in the U.S.), and acute deflation worldwide. Factors contributing to the crisis included the speculative boom of the 1920s, banking failures, and protectionist trade policies like the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. The depression had profound social and political effects, including the rise of extremist movements in Europe. Recovery was slow and uneven, spurred by government interventions like the New Deal in the U.S., but the economic slump was largely overcome by the onset of World War II.

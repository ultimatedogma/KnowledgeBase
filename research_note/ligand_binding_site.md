# Ligand Binding Site

- From BioLiP paper: For a receptor residue, if the closest atomic distance between the residue and the ligand is within certain distance cutoff, then the residue is defined as a ligand-binding site residue. The cutoff is set to be 0.5 plus the sum of the Van der Waalâ€™s radius of the two atoms under investigation.

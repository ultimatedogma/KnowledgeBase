# Polyphyly

### Quick definition (in plain language)

A **polyphyletic group** is a set of organisms that have been lumped together even though they **do not share their most‑recent common ancestor within the group**. In other words, they look or act alike for some reason, but their similarities arose **independently** in separate evolutionary lineages.

### How to spot one — contrast with the other two “‑phyletic” groupings

| Term                     | Who’s included?                                                                                 | Most‑recent common ancestor (MRCA)                    | Typical use in modern systematics                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monophyletic 单系群** (clade 演化支) | An ancestor *and* **all** of its descendants                                                    | **Inside** the group                                  | Preferred; reflects true evolutionary history                                |
| **Paraphyletic 并系群**         | An ancestor and **some, but not all,** of its descendants                                       | Inside the group, but at least one branch is left out | Sometimes kept for convenience (e.g., “reptiles” without birds)              |
| **Polyphyletic 多系群**         | Members chosen from **different branches** that do **not** share the same MRCA inside the group | **Outside** the group                                 | Discouraged; groups organisms by superficial similarity rather than ancestry |

### Classic examples

| Example group                                 | Why it’s polyphyletic                                                                                                                  | Key independent origins                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“Flying animals” (bats + birds + insects)** | Flight evolved separately in insects, in pterosaurs (now extinct), in birds, and in mammals (bats).                                    | At least four distinct evolutionary origins of powered flight                   |
| **“Algae” in the traditional sense**          | Green, red, brown algae, and cyanobacteria each have different ancestors; photosynthesis was acquired multiple times by endosymbiosis. | Separate endosymbiotic events and lineages                                      |
| **Warm‑blooded vertebrates (“homeotherms”)**  | Birds and mammals regulate body temperature, but their last shared ancestor was a reptile‑like amniote that was probably cold‑blooded. | Endothermy evolved independently in mammals and in the lineage leading to birds |

### Why taxonomists avoid polyphyletic groups

1. **Misleading about ancestry** – they hide the true branching pattern of the tree of life.
2. **Unstable classifications** – new data (e.g., DNA sequences) often force these groups to be split up or re‑defined.
3. **Poor predictive power** – knowing that two members belong to the same polyphyletic group tells you little about their genetics, physiology, or ecology.

### How polyphyletic groupings arise

* **Superficial traits**: Grouping by one striking feature (e.g., wings) without checking evolutionary history.
* **Convergent evolution**: Independent evolution of similar adaptations creates look‑alike organisms.
* **Historical legacy**: Some names pre‑date modern phylogenetics (e.g., “Volvocaceae” once lumped unrelated green algae).

### Take‑home analogy (for a 5‑year‑old)

Imagine sorting animals into teams by *coloring their shoes*: you put all creatures wearing red sneakers on Team Red. A parrot, a crab, and a fox end up together—they all have red feet, but they’re not from the same family. That team is like a **polyphyletic group**: members look similar in one way, but they aren’t closely related.

**Bottom line:** In evolutionary biology, a polyphyletic group is a “mix‑and‑match” collection that ignores the actual family tree, so modern classification tries to replace such groups with monophyletic clades that capture true common ancestry.

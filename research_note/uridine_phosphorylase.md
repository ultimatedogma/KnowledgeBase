# Uridine Phosphorylase

Uridine Phosphorylase 尿苷磷酸化酶

[UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P12758/entry), [PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1RXU)

Catalyed reaction: 

- Uridine + Phosphate -> α-D-ribose 1-phosphate + Uracil
- 尿苷 + 磷酸 -> α-D-核糖-1-磷酸 + 尿嘧啶

Uridine has substrate specificity for this reaction, the reaction is only works for U, but not for other Pyrimidines including T and C

The reason for this substrate specificity:

- The pyrimidines to be considered are uridine, cytidine and thymidine.
- three hydrogen bonds is responsible for the substrate specificity (following figure)
- the absence of OH2′ from thymidine
- nitrogen atom at the 3 position of cytidine is deprotonated at physiological pH

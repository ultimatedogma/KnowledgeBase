# PointNetLK

PointNetLK, which repurposes PointNet as a learnable “imaging” function and embeds the Lucas & Kanade alignment algorithm into a single recurrent deep network. This unified model achieves state-of-the-art point cloud registration accuracy, broad shape generalization, and fast, efficient computation.
